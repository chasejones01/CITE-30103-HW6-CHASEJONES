Question 8 - Global verses Local Scope

global_var is declared outside main() function : this is a global variable
	- File scope and accessible anywhere in this file after declaration
	- Exists for the entire program lifetime and execution

local_var is declared inside main() function : this is a local variable
	- Block scope and accessible only within main().
	- Exists only while main() is executing and not visible outside

Example of Output:
Global variable: 25
Local variable: 5
