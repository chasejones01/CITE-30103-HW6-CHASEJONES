Original:
	int 1value = 10; // 
	float avg-rate = 12.5;
	char Class = 'A'; 

Errors and Explanations:
	1. '1value" - invalid since identifiers cannot begin with a digit.
		Correction: int value1 = 10;
	2. 'avg-rate' - invalid because hyphens (-) are not allowed in the names of variables.
		Correction: float avg_rate = 12.5;
	3. 'Class' - is valid and begins with a capital letter which is allowed in C, but it utilzes a name that could conflict with keywords in other languages; best practice to avoid reserved-like namesand use lowercase for variable names
		Correction: char class_grade = 'A';

Fixed Code:
	int value1 = 10;
	float avg_rate = 12.5;
	char class_grade = 'A';

Rules: Identifiers must start with letters or underscore and can contain letters, digits, underscores only.
